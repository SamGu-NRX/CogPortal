 * page install the same tool whenever they read it. Move it deliberately when
 * a reviewed CLI lands. The install line forces the reinstall because the
 * version does not change between pins.
 *
 * This pin and the portal deploy are coupled in both directions and have to
 * move together. The CLI at 8e09a07 does not send `checkedBenchmarkId`, so a
 * portal that scopes setup evidence would leave a student who ran every
 * command on this page short of complete, with nothing on the page to do
 * about it. In the other direction the evidence request is `.strict()`, so
 * this CLI against a portal that predates the field is refused outright.
 * Nobody can reach that combination through this page, which serves whichever
 * pin its own deploy carries, but pointing `--portal` at an older deployment
 * does. Installed into a clean 3.14 venv from this commit on 2026-09-10:
 * `_setup_payload` sends the id for a scoped check and omits it for `link`.
